    "    Every file in the approved files list will become either a node or a relationship.\n",
    "    Determining whether a file likely represents a node or a relationship is based\n",

    "    - Full relationships _do not have_ unique identifiers, but instead have references to the primary keys of the source and destination nodes.\n",
    "    - The absence of a single, unique identifier is a strong indicator that a file is a full relationship.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Reference relationships:\n",
    "    - Reference relationships appear as foreign key references in node files\n",
    "    - Reference relationship foreign key column names often hint at the destination node and relationship type\n",
    "    - References may be hierarchical container relationships, with terminology revealing parent-child, \"has\", \"contains\", membership, or similar relationship\n",
    "    - References may be peer relationships, that is often a self-reference to a similar class of nodes. For example, \"knows\" or \"see also\"\n",
