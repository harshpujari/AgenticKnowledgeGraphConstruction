# Agentic Knowledge Graph Construction

A knowledge graph is a structured representation of information that stores data as a network of interconnected entities and their relationships.

## Overview

Knowledge graphs model real-world information as nodes (entities) and edges (relationships). They enable machines to understand context and meaning beyond simple keyword matching, powering semantic search, recommendations, and higher-level AI reasoning.

## Key characteristics

- **Structure**
  - Nodes represent entities (people, places, concepts).
  - Edges represent relationships between entities, forming a graph database.

- **Format**
  - Commonly represented as subject–predicate–object triples.
  - Example: `"Paris" (subject) → "is capital of" (predicate) → "France" (object)`.

- **Purpose**
  - Capture context and semantic relationships so applications can reason about data rather than just match text.

## Common examples

- Google Knowledge Graph (enhances search results)
- Amazon product recommendation systems
- Wikidata (structured data underlying Wikipedia)

## Note on "graph"

The term "graph" refers to the mathematical graph structure (nodes and edges), not a visual chart or plot. It denotes a network of connected data points that can be queried and reasoned over.
